# Williams Real Estate Portal

Welcome to the Williams Real Estate Portal! This is an open source codebase for our real estate website, where users can explore property listings, learn about our dedicated team of agents, and initiate contact to discuss potential opportunities.

## Why Open Source?

We've chosen to open source this project for a couple of reasons:

1. **Build in Public**: By developing our project in the public eye, we aim to maintain transparency, encourage community feedback, and iterate our platform with the help of diverse perspectives.
   
2. **Learning and Improvement**: Open sourcing our code allows others to see the decisions and mistakes we make along the way. We believe in learning from the community and improving the quality of our codebase through collective knowledge.

## Features

- **Real Estate Listings**: Browse through detailed listings of properties, including photos, descriptions, and key features. Users can filter and search listings based on various criteria such as location, price, and type of property.

- **Agent Bios**: Get to know our team! Each real estate agent has a profile detailing their experience, specialties, and contact information.

- **Contact an Agent**: Users can directly contact agents through the platform to inquire more about a property or schedule viewings.
